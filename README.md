RoutingProblem contains algorithm, however the data structures needed to 
store each particle are stored in Particle.m. Both of the files are 
required to run the algorithm.

To execute, extract all the files into the current matlab folder and RUN
GENVALUES.m which will load the variables required and call the necessary
functions. By default, GENVALUES.m will run 1 iterations of the 100 
customer problem which will take approximately 1.5 minutes, then plot
the values
